Define your problem mathematically as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem:
- Define the variables and domains. 
- Define the constraints.
- Define the objective function. 

Australia map coloring problem solution (From Slides):
Variables (7): WA, NT, Q, NSW, V, SA, T
Domains: red, green, blue
Constraints: adjacent regions must have different colors
WA≠NT, WA≠SA, NT≠SA, NT≠Q, SA≠Q, SA≠NSW, SA≠V, Q≠NSW, NSW≠V
Solutions are assignments satisfying all constraints (Complete and consistent), 
e.g.  {WA=red, NT=green, Q=red, NSW=green, V=red, SA=blue, T=green}
